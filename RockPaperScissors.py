# Assignment 4.2, #4.17
# Write a program that plays rock-paper-scissor.Â  The program randomly
# generates a number 0, 1, pr 2 representing scissor, rock and paper,
# respectively. The program prompts the user to enter a number 0, 1, or
# 2 and displays a message indicating whether the user or the computer
# wins, loses, or draws.
# Time Spent = 2 hours

# Honor Code: I pledge that this program represents my own program code.
# I received help from no one in designing and debugging my program.

# include random module to generate opponent hand in this game of chance
import random

# Welcome, title, explanation

      "The winner is determined by classic rock, paper, scissor standards:\n"
      "Rock smashes Scissors, Scissors cut Paper, and "
      "Paper covers a Rock\n\n")

# Prompt user to enter a number
print("When you are ready, choose your weapon, then press [ENTER] \n")
print("Press 0 for scissors, 1 for rock, or 2 for paper\n")
